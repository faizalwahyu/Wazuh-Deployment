Wazuh can be integrated with VirusTotal, a service that analyzes files and URLs for viruses, worms, and other kinds of malware using multiple antivirus engines.
What it does:
- When enabled, Wazuh can automatically query VirusTotal to check if a file hash or URL is known to be malicious.
- It helps enrich alert data with threat intelligence, improving incident response.

Limitations:
- Free VirusTotal API:
  * Limited to 4 requests per minute
  * Low priority in queue processing
  * No historical search or advanced intelligence features

- Premium VirusTotal API (VirusTotal Intelligence):
  * Higher request limits
  * Faster response time
  * Access to advanced features like historical data, file behavior analysis, and more detailed reports

- To use the integration, you need to:
  * Obtain a VirusTotal API key (free or paid)
  * Configure the key in the wazuh-integratord or ruleset
  * Ensure alerts (like from FIM or malware detection) trigger the integration
