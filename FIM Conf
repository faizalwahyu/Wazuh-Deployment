File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) is a security process that watches important files and directories on a system for any changes. 
It detects when files are added, modified, or deleted. 
This helps you quickly spot unauthorized or suspicious activities, like hacking attempts or malware infections, by alerting you when something unexpected happens to critical files.

This is the sample add configuration

<syscheck>
  <disabled>no</disabled>
  <frequency>3600</frequency> <!-- scan every hour -->
  <scan_on_start>yes</scan_on_start>
  <directories>/etc</directories> <!-- monitor /etc folder -->
  <alert_new_files>yes</alert_new_files>
</syscheck>
